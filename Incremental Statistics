/*  SELF ASSESSMENT of whether my code is easy to understand.
   1. Did I use easy-to-understand meaningful variable names?
       Mark out of 5: 5
       Comment: I have used easy-to-understand and meaningful variables.
   2. Did I format the variable names properly (in lowerCamelCase)?
       Mark out of 5: 5
       Comment: Yes, I have formatted my code properly.
   3. Did I indent the code appropriately?
